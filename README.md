This project is a Favorites Management System built with React (Next.js) that allows users to search for NPM packages, add them to their favorites, and manage the list effectively. The system provides functionalities like adding a reason for a favorite, editing reasons, and deleting items with confirmation.

The search functionality, powered by the NPMS API, displays results in a scrollable list where users can select packages to add to their favorites. Favorites are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.

Reusable components like Button, CustomModal, and TextArea are implemented to ensure consistent design and simplify code maintenance. Success messages and confirmations are displayed using modals for better user experience, replacing standard alerts.

The Favorites page lists all saved items and offers features to view, edit, or delete them. Edits update the reason dynamically, while deletions prompt a confirmation modal to avoid accidental actions. Navigation between the home and favorites pages is seamless, enhancing usability.

This modular and scalable approach enables easy extension of features, making the project a robust foundation for managing user favorites efficiently.
